# Bike-Buyer-Excel-Project

I used a dataset with bike purchase information to create a simple dashboard using Microsoft Excel. I would have liked the dashboard to be more dynamic including slicers to dive deeper into the visualizations but was limited with the web version of Excel. 

I also got to clean the data and add some more fields to be used in the Dashboard.
